### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes (`npm test`)
5. Make sure your code lints (`npm run lint`)
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/typed-result.git
cd typed-result
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a branch for your feature or fix
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

4. Make your changes and write tests

5. Run tests to ensure everything works
```bash
npm test
npm run test:coverage
```

6. Run linting
```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```

7. Build the project
```bash

## Testing

We aim for 100% test coverage. When adding new features or fixing bugs:

- Write unit tests for all new code
- Update existing tests if behavior changes
- Add integration tests for complex features
- Include edge cases in your tests

Example test:
```typescript
describe('Result.map', () => {
  it('should transform success values', () => {
    const result = Result.ok(5).map(x => x * 2);
    expect(result.isOk).toBe(true);
    expect(result.unwrap()).toBe(10);
  });

  it('should pass through errors', () => {
    const error = new Error('test');
    const result = Result.fail<number>(error).map(x => x * 2);
    expect(result.isOk).toBe(false);
    expect(result.error).toBe(error);
  });
});
```

## Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add JSDoc comments for all public APIs
- Update the documentation site for new features
- Include code examples in documentation

## Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation only changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc)
- `refactor:` Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` Performance improvement
- `test:` Adding missing tests
- `chore:` Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
```
feat: add Result.partition method
fix: correct type inference for nested Results
docs: add migration guide from try-catch
```

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow the existing code style
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Prefer functional programming patterns

## Review Process

1. A maintainer will review your PR
2. They may request changes or ask questions
3. Once approved, your PR will be merged
4. Your contribution will be included in the next release

## Release Process

We use semantic versioning and automated releases:

1. PRs are merged to `main`
2. CI runs tests and checks
3. Semantic release determines version bump
4. New version is published to npm
5. Release notes are generated automatically
