## Marketing Channels & Tactics

### Content Strategy
1. **Educational Content**
   - "Why Result Types?" series
   - Error handling best practices
   - Migration case studies
   - Performance comparisons

2. **Technical Content**
   - Deep dives into implementation
   - TypeScript type system explorations
   - Integration tutorials
   - Advanced patterns

### SEO Strategy
- Target keywords: "typescript error handling", "result type typescript", "functional error handling"
- Create comprehensive guides for long-tail keywords
- Build backlinks through guest posts and collaborations

### Partnership Strategy
- Collaborate with TypeScript team
- Partner with popular TypeScript libraries
- Sponsor TypeScript conferences
- Contribute to TypeScript documentation

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- npm downloads (target: 10k/week by month 6)
- GitHub stars (target: 1k by month 3)
- Test coverage (maintain 100%)
- Bundle size (keep under 5KB gzipped)
- TypeScript strict mode compliance

### Community Metrics
- GitHub contributors (target: 20+ by month 6)
- Discord members (target: 500+ by month 6)
- Documentation site traffic
- Issue response time (< 24 hours)
- PR review time (< 48 hours)

### Business Metrics
- Enterprise adoptions
- Framework integrations
- Conference talks accepted
- Blog post engagement

## Maintenance Plan

### Regular Activities
- Weekly dependency updates
- Bi-weekly community calls
- Monthly performance reviews
- Quarterly roadmap updates
- Annual major version planning

### Support Structure
- Dedicated maintainer hours
- Community moderators
- Documentation team
- Security response team

## Budget Considerations

### Essential Costs
- Domain name and hosting
- Documentation hosting (Vercel/Netlify)
- CI/CD resources
- Logo design
- Conference sponsorships

### Optional Investments
- Paid advertising
- Professional video production
- Technical writer
- Community manager
- Security audits

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- Performance regression → Automated benchmarks

### Community Risks
- Maintainer burnout → Clear boundaries, delegation
- Toxic behavior → Code of conduct enforcement
- Fork fragmentation → Open governance model

## Long-term Vision (Year 2+)

- Become the de-facto Result type library for TypeScript
- Official TypeScript team recommendation
- Integration in major frameworks by default
- Book publication on functional error handling
- Conference dedicated to error handling patterns
- Sustainable funding through sponsorships

## Next Steps

1. Review and refine this roadmap
2. Set up project foundation (Phase 1)
3. Recruit initial contributors
4. Begin documentation site development
5. Start building community presence

Remember: Building a successful open source project is a marathon, not a sprint. Focus on providing genuine value, building a welcoming community, and maintaining high quality standards.
